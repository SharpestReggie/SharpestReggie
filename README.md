# Reggie Shapiro's Bug Bounty Journey

## The Story So Far 

### My Background

> I'm  is a 24 year old who just graduated from community college with an associates degree in Network Administration. He's always been fascinated by hacking and cybersecurity ever since he watched The Matrix at a way too young age. Now it's time for Reggie to fulfill his destiny and join the ranks of elite bug bounty hunters.


### Tech Stack    

- Kali Linux - I just installed it last week and am still figuring out how to use it but I've seen all the cool hacker movies so I'm basically an expert already
- Burp Suite - I just heard about this the other day and am excited to try "intercepting traffic" like I've seen the hackers do on CSI Cyber   
- Python - I took one coding class and learned "Hello World" so I'm ready for some real scripts
- Google - My most used tool for any problem I encounter. Nothing a little "how to hack facebook using kali linux" search can't solve!
